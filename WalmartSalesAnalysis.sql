-- Interestingly, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays emerge as the top-performing days for achieving higher ratings. 
-- Moving forward, focusing on areas of improvement for Branch B and leveraging peak rating days across all 
-- branches could be key strategies for maximizing overall performance and customer satisfaction.
